# FIR-IIR-Filter-Design
Digital Signal Processing
In today's digital environment, digital signals are becoming increasingly common. 
Being able to manage these signals is a valuable ability for an engineer. 
Filtering digital signals is one method of signal modification. When accurate data is required, as is expected from an engineer, the removal of undesirable signals from a supplied data is critical. 
The creation of filters utilizing the two most prominent methods, FIR and IIR, is outlined and shown in this short project. 
The following are the filters that will be used in this project:

•	Low Pass Filter
•	High Pass Filter
•	Band Pass Filter
•	Band Stop Filter
